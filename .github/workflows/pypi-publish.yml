          ### ⚠️ Important
          
          This is a **test release** published to Test PyPI for validation.
          - Use this for testing and validation only
          - Production installations should wait for the stable release
          - This version is NOT available on Production PyPI
          
          ### 🔧 What's New
          
          - Package available on Test PyPI for testing
          - All integration tests passed
          - See [commit history](https://github.com/ambivo-corp/ambivo-agents/commits/${{ steps.target.outputs.tag }}) for detailed changes
          
          ### 🚀 Quick Start
          
          ```python
          from ambivo_agents import KnowledgeBaseAgent
          
          # Create agent with explicit context
          agent, context = KnowledgeBaseAgent.create(user_id="your_user")
          print(f"Agent {agent.agent_id} ready!")
          
          # Use agent...
          await agent.cleanup_session()
          ```

          - **Test PyPI Package**: https://test.pypi.org/project/ambivo-agents/
          - **Environment**: `testpypi` (testing only)
          
          ### ➡️ Next Steps
          
          ${{ steps.version_check.outputs.skip_upload == 'true' && 'This version already exists. To publish a new version:\n  1. Update version in your code (e.g., 1.3.1)\n  2.
